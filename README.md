# 7-Days-To-Die_noMad_MOD
Nomad Mod v1.0 for 7 Days to Die

This is the initial release of my new Nomad Mod to the public.

In the initial release crafting is mostly removed from the game. You can craft bandages and bedrolls. You can assemble guns and repair items.

Everything else must be looted or bought at a large markup from the traders.


--INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS--
If you're not using the Launcher simply place these 2 folder into your root 7 Days to Die folder and replace files when it asks you to.




--FUTURE UPDATES--
This is the base version of the mod. I have intentions of adding new zombies and custom POIs that dont break the theme of the mod as well
as some cool new looting features.

On top of that I will also be working on 2 new versions of the mod once thats done. An easier version where there is still no crafting,
but when you break any block in the world, say a concrete block, it gives you that block. This allows building by taking pieces out of 
other buildings.

There will also be an extreme version that includes no crafting at all, no traders, no repairs, and no assembling set further into the
rundown future. I hope everyone enjoys and I cant wait to put out more updates!
